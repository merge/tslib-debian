tslib (1.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Timo Juhani Lindfors ]
  * Add patch allow_EV_VERSION_0 to continue supporting Linux 2.6.36 and
    older. Previously kernel support depended on the kernel headers that
    tslib was built against. (Closes: #623095)
  
  * Do not refuse to work with old kernels. We can safely work with
    kernels that use EV_VERSION 0x010000 API since we use no features from
    0x010001 yet. (Closes: #623095)

  [ Hector Oron ]
